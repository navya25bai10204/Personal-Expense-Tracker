The Personal Expense Tracker is a simple, user-friendly Python program that helps you keep track of your daily spending. It uses a plain text file (in CSV format) to store your expenses securely, so you never lose your records even after closing the program.

With this tool, you can add new expenses by entering the date (which defaults to today if you skip it), the category of spending like Food or Travel, the amount spent, and a brief note if you want. You can view all your expenses displayed clearly in a table, remove any entry you no longer want, and see quick summaries showing how much you've spent in total and by each category.

The program handles errors gracefully, making sure you enter valid numbers and necessary fields. It offers a simple menu-driven interface that makes it easy to add, view, delete, or review your spending at any time.

Built using Python’s standard libraries like csv, os, and datetime, this project is a great way to learn essential programming skills including file management, data handling, and user input validation.

To use it, just run the program and follow the on-screen menu. Your data is automatically saved in a file called expenses.csv that can be opened and edited in Excel, Google Sheets or any spreadsheet software.

Future upgrades could include adding filters by date or category, generating monthly or weekly spending reports with charts, enhancing security for multiple users, or moving the data storage into a database for handling more data efficiently.

The data is stored in this form:
